# IDRiD_multi-task
This repository contains the implementation of the "Modular Vision-Based Multi-task Learning for Eye Disease Diagnosis" project, specifically applied to the IDRiD dataset. The project's core objective is to develop a modular deep learning system capable of analyzing retinal images. This system is designed for multi-task learning, simultaneously performing both disease grading (multi-class classification) and lesion segmentation.
